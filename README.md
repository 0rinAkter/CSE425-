we cluster handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using an autoencoder to create latent representations, followed by K-Means clustering. Visualize the results with PCA and t-SNE, and evaluate clustering quality with metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index.
